# ComfyUI-SeeCoder
ComfyUI nodes to use the SeeCoder from [Prompt-Free-Diffusion](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Prompt-Free-Diffusion)

## Installation

Prompt-Free-Diffusion has a few different models to choose from on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/shi-labs/prompt-free-diffusion/tree/main/pretrained/pfd/seecoder).
The anime model tends to work best for all use cases. Download them to the `ComfyUI/models/seecoder/` directory.

Additionally, you can use one of the specific unconditional provided by the original repo from [here](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Prompt-Free-Diffusion/tree/master/assets).
Download those to the `ComfyUI/models/seecoder/` directory. They are optional, but improve the quailty of the generation.

## Examples
See `example_workflows` directory for examples.
